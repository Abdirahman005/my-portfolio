      <p>Hi, I'm Abdirahman Muktar, a passionate Full Stack Software Engineer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development. I enjoy building robust, scalable web applications that deliver seamless user experiences and solve real-world problems.

My frontend skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, which I use to create responsive, dynamic, and visually appealing interfaces. On the backend, I work with Node.js, Express, Python, Flask, and MySQL to develop secure, high-performance APIs and services.

Iâ€™m a fast learner, problem-solver, and team player who is always eager to learn new technologies and contribute to impactful projects. Whether collaborating in teams or working independently, I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and delivering high-quality solutions.
